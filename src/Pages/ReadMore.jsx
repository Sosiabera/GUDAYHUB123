      <Title>GudayHub: Connecting Freelancers and Employers</Title>
      
      <SectionTitle>Project Overview</SectionTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        GudayHub, a system for freelancers and employers to connect. Specifically, the project aims to identify existing systemic challenges in the job search process and design a website tailored for freelancers who lack formal educational backgrounds. GudayHub will enable freelancers to showcase their skills and experience to a wider audience, featuring a user-friendly interface, advanced search filters, and a rating system. Additionally, the platform will include an optimized algorithm that notifies freelancers when suitable tasks are available, ultimately fostering collaboration between freelancers and employers.
      </Paragraph>
      
      <SectionTitle>Primary Issues Addressed</SectionTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        The primary issue addressed by this project is the lack of suitable platforms for non-graduate freelancers or those who lack specific skill sets. Many jobs can be accomplished without specialized skills, yet existing platforms often fail to connect these individuals with appropriate opportunities. Additionally, maintaining productivity outside the traditional workplace remains a significant challenge, with part-time and side gigs being hard to find despite their abundance. There is also the difficulty of locating jobs that match oneâ€™s skills and geographic preferences.
      </Paragraph>
      
      <Paragraph>
        The job search process itself is cumbersome, often requiring physical presence to find job opportunities and submit CVs for interviews, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Other challenges include managing increasing employee pay rates based on their needs, maintaining productivity, meeting client demands while handling unreasonable expectations, and ensuring timely payment to maintain financial stability.
      </Paragraph>
      
      <SectionTitle>Project Goals</SectionTitle>

        GudayHub aims to address these problems by creating a system that connects freelancers and employers more effectively, streamlining the job search process, and ensuring that suitable job opportunities are accessible to all freelancers, regardless of their educational background or specific skill sets.
